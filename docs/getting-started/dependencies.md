# Dependencies
:::caution Work in progress
This page is incomplete.
:::

## Unreal Editor
Follow the instructions on [Epic Game's website](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/download) to install version **4.27** of the Unreal Editor.

During the installation you can deselect some of the options such as the Android SDK.

### Visual Studio/Rider
Once Unreal Editor is installed you will also need Visual Studio 2019 or later.
You can follow the [Unreal Engine documentation](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/ProductionPipelines/DevelopmentSetup/VisualStudioSetup/) to set this up correctly.

If you prefer JetBrains IDEs then Rider with UnrealLink is a great option,
but you will still need most of the Visual Studio tools installed.
Setup instructions are available at [Jetbrain's documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rider/Unreal_Engine__Before_You_Start.html) site.

### Getting the modkit
The modkit for the full game release is not yet available.
Check back later this week for a download link and instructions.

## UE4SS
You can optionally download UE4SS if you wish to create lua mods,
or to provide extra runtime debugging tools.

## Additional tools
For a list of additional tools you can use when creating mods, see the [Additional Tools](/docs/additional-resources/tools) page.
