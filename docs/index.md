# Introduction

## Basics

Welcome to the PAYDAY 3 Modding Documentation site!

We are only at the beginning of the life cycle of this game, but it has already been proven that advanced modding is possible.

:::tip
We recommend you join the [Moolah Modding](https://discord.gg/VTe6pVYjWR) and [Modworkshop](https://discord.gg/Eear4JW) Discord servers
for questions and to interact with experienced members of the modding community.
:::

## For Users
The Moolah Mod Launcher is not yet available for public use.
Check back later for a download link and instructions.

## For Developers
This documentation will guide you through two ways of modding:

* Using the Unreal Editor, with a modkit containing assets generated from the game
* Using UE4SS, which is mainly a LUA toolkit and runtime property inspector

### Returning Modders
Many things have changed since PAYDAY 2, to view some big changes that will affect PAYDAY 2 mappers,
view the [PAYDAY 2 to PAYDAY 3 Cheatsheet](/docs/additional-resources/payday2-payday3-cheatsheet) page.

## Contributing
Explain where people can go to contribute to the modding toolchain and documentation.
