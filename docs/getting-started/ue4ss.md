)

Note:
If you had a previous version of UE4SS installed, make sure to overwrite UE4SS.dll.
Any mods built for the old version of UE4SS will not work with this one. If you experience crashes on load, it is most likely caused by an outdated mod.
In the case that you find an outdated mod, contact the mod author to let them know to update the mod to rebuild the mod with this version of RE-UE4SS
